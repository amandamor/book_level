This project focuses on the development and implementation of a classification model designed to assess and categorize books based on their English language difficulty level. This initiative aims to enhance the reading experience for non-native English speakers by providing appropriately leveled reading materials.
** Achievements:
* Successful Model Development: We have successfully created a robust classification model that accurately predicts the difficulty level of English books, ensuring non-native speakers have access to suitable reading materials.
* Enhanced Reading Selection: By evaluating and curating personalized content, we improved the selection process for over 1000 different reading materials, making it easier for non-native readers to find books that match their language proficiency.
* Personalized Content Curation: Our model enables a more tailored approach to reading, allowing educators and learners to choose books that align with individual learning needs and preferences.
* Data-Driven Insights: Leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, we identified key linguistic features that contribute to the difficulty level of texts, providing valuable insights for future content development.
**Conclusion: This project has significantly contributed to the field of language learning by providing a reliable tool for categorizing English books according to their difficulty. Our efforts have enhanced the accessibility and enjoyment of reading for non-native English speakers, fostering a more inclusive and effective learning environment and I am continuing to improve this project.
